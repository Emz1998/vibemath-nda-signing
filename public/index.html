          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            [Dating app] is an emotionally intelligent dating app built around a
            5-round reveal game. Users gradually uncover age, occupation, voice,

            by a Cupid AI. The app is designed to prioritize emotional
            connection, reduce superficial swiping, and create a fun, respectful
            dating journey.

          <h2>Why Include Gamers?</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>The Problem in Voice Chat Games:</strong> You connect with
            someone during a match, but after the game ends, it rarely leads to
            meaningful connection. You might add each other, but it stays
            surface-level.
